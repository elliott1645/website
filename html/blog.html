      First Blog Post
    </h2>
      <p>
	This is my blog. I will be posting in it frequently. I will talk about different ideas that I have and also different thoughts. I will ponder life and ask questions.
      </p>
      <p>
	I enjoy thinking of  questions and ideas. Some of them are ridiculous and crazy but as long as they are interesting, I like them. This blog should be entertaining to some. Stick around to see what's in store
